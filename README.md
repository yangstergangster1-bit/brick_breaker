Overview - 
	This project is a simple recreation of the game brick breaker arcade game. WE recreated this in the programming language python using the pygame library. The gist of the game is that player will move a paddle using the left and right arrowkeys to bounce a moving ball and break bricks at the top of the screen. The end objective is to eventually break all the bricks. 

How to play - 
	MOST IMPORTANT - You have to install the pygame library in order to play this game. To do that if you have the python file open in a code editor, then you can type the following in the command window:

              ---------------------------         pip install pygame              ---------------------------------

Then you should be good to go to run the file and play the game

To play you can use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle left or right respectively.
